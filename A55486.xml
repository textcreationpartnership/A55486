         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N order to the profitable Peruſal of this Book, we are firſt to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, how the <hi>Son of God</hi> came to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned and intereſted in the Affairs of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;</hi> eſpecially, in the grand work of Redemption and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>This Work was reſolved and concluded <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Creation,</hi> either of Mankind, or of the World, by vertue of a <hi>Secret,</hi> but a moſt Gracious <hi>Covenant,</hi> tranſacted between the Father and the Son from Eternity, which Covenant is often mentioned in the Goſpel, under the title of the <hi>Everlaſting Covenant,</hi>

                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 2. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 11 <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 6</note> and is called <hi>the Eternal Purpoſe, which he purpoſed in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord;</hi> and <hi>the Everlaſting Goſpel.</hi> In all which places the word <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:98443:10"/>
We cannot apprehend any other Conditions in this Covenant, but only, that the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head in the <hi>Perſon</hi> of the <hi>Eternal Father,</hi> required performance of the future Laws to be impoſed on Mankind, the intended Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, with promiſe of <hi>Life</hi> to the Performer, and the penalty of <hi>Death</hi> to the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor.</p>
            <p>To theſe covenanted Conditions, the ſame <hi>Godhead</hi> in the Perſon of the <hi>Eternal Son,</hi> reſtipulated and agreed, that Mankind ſhould either perform the ſaid Laws, or ſo ſuffer. This we conceive to be that Covenant, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to be atteſted by the ſame Godhead, in the <hi>Perſon</hi> of the <hi>Eternal Spirit</hi> of the Father and the Son, who alſo untill this day (as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh) <hi>beareth witneſs with</hi>

               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon theſe premiſed Reaſons it is, (as I conceive) that the Apoſtle calls Chriſt <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>In order to the performance of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, we are next to conſider that <hi>God the Son</hi> aſſumed our Human Nature, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came <hi>perfect Man,</hi> and in that Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, did actually and perfectly perform that
<pb facs="tcp:98443:10"/>
whole Law or Covenant, for which he was engaged, in the behalf of Mankind; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it is ſaid of the <hi>Son, In the Volume of the Book it is written of me, to do thy</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 7.</note> 
               <hi>will O God, (in Capite libri)</hi> that is, <hi>in notitia Praedeſtinationis aeternae,</hi> ſaith the <note place="margin">Dionyſ. Car. in loc.</note> Expoſitor. The Writing in the Volume of the Book ſignifies, that he was preordained, or predeſtinated from Eternity ſo to do. He had ſaid before, <hi>Sacrifice and Offering thou wouldeſt not, but a Body thou haſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for me—then ſaid I, lo I come;</hi> all which words were taken out of the 40th. Pſalm. From hence it is, that <hi>God the Son</hi> is called the <hi>Angel,</hi> or <hi>Meſſenger of the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mal.</hi> 3, 1.</note> 
               <hi>Govenant,</hi> becauſe he was intereſted and ſent, for performance of the ſaid Covenant. And therefore the whole Flock of Mankind was committed to him, as his Sheep, to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and governed; for ſo it is expreſly ſaid, <hi>that the Father gave them to him;</hi>

            </p>
            <p>This Engagement of <hi>the Son</hi> (as Surety for Mankind.) occaſioned thoſe words of the two great Apoſtles, for thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of God, <hi>He hath choſen us in him</hi>

               <note place="margin">19. 20.</note> 
               <hi>was fore-ordained, before the Foundation of the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe expreſſions of <hi>Choſing us in Chriſt,</hi> and of <hi>Grace given us in Chriſt,</hi> and of <hi>Chriſt fore-ordained,</hi> and of <hi>Life promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,</hi> and that <hi>before the Foundation of the World.</hi> And all theſe, only <hi>in, and for Chriſt,</hi> muſt needs relate to that aforeſaid <hi>Eternal purpoſe, Covenant</hi> or Agreement, beeween God the Father and God the Son, before the Creation.</p>
            <p>For to whom could the Promiſe be made, before either Man, or Angel, or Archangel, or any Creatures were made, but only to the <hi>Eternal Word,</hi> or Son of the Father? And why to him? but only, becauſe the Son entred into that Covenant, and thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the Surety and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaker for Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Therefore to him only was this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made, and in him, and for him to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. And by vertue of this Covenant, the Lord Jeſus became neceſſarily obliged, both to perform the Law, and alſo to under go his bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="tcp:98443:11"/>
paſſions of death, as himſelf often acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 21.</note> and all the four Evangeliſts have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mar.</hi> 8. 31 <hi>Luke</hi>
               </note> from his mouth, that <hi>He muſt ſuffer many things, and be killed.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">24. 46. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 14</note>
            </p>
            <p>All this being preſumed and granted, there is yet one thing more (of the greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to us) to be conſidered, <hi>viz.</hi> how his Obedience in performing the Law, and his Death for the tranſgreſſions thereof, can be ſatisfactory to Divine Juſtice for us, ſeeing God hath often declared, that one ſhall not be puniſhed for another, eſpecially an Innocent for a malefactor; which ſeems to be our caſe, for we are the Tranſgreſſors, but Chriſt is innocent, yet he is puniſhed, and we quitted.</p>
            <p>Our Anſwer is, that <hi>Chriſt, and Mankind,</hi> are not to be looked on as <hi>Two,</hi> but as <hi>One.</hi> Nor is his death, the death of one for another, but of the ſame; He as a Surety, and we as the principal Debtor; He as the Head, and we as the Members of the ſame Body. The <hi>Surety</hi> and the <hi>principal,</hi> are but one Perſon in Law, and the Head, and the other parts are both one, and the ſame Body in Nature.</p>
            <p>Therefore, that the proceedings of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, concerning the work of Mans Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, might appear to be contrived, not only with infinite <hi>Mercy,</hi> but alſo with exact <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</hi> God at the beginning ſo ordered, that the Redeemer, and the Redeemed ſhould be
<pb facs="tcp:98443:12"/>
               <hi>united</hi> in One original Fountain, who to that end planted all the Bodies and Souls both of Chriſt, and of all Mankind, in that <hi>One Firſt Man,</hi> from whoſe Fleſh and Soul, both Chriſt, and all Mankind, have derived their Bodies and their Souls. In this conſiſteth our <hi>Union</hi> with Chriſt, and hence it is, that Chriſt and we are accounted but <hi>One,</hi> and this is that <hi>Union</hi> which was meant, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by Chriſt under thoſe figurative words, of <hi>Eating his Fleſh, and Drinking his Blood.</hi> The clear demonstration and proof whereof, is the whole, and only deſign of this enſuing Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>The learned <hi>Romaniſts</hi> I conceive, do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly underſtand, that the benefits which come by Chriſt, cannot otherwiſe with juſtice be communicated to Mankind, but only by the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of Chriſt with us, <hi>viz.</hi> of his Fleſh with our fleſh, and of his Soul with our ſouls; And therefore they have phanſied this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion to be effected, by an Oral and carnal Eating of his <hi>living</hi> Fleſh, and Drinking his Blood in the Sacred Euchariſt, by their way of <hi>Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the learned <hi>French</hi> Cardinal of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> in his Book of the Euchariſt, written in <hi>French,</hi> affirmeth, that the real natural Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſt in the Sacrament is to great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt purpoſe, becauſe the Reſidence of Chriſts
<pb facs="tcp:98443:12"/>
Natural Body in our bodies, doth really and ſubſtantially joyn us unto God, eſtabliſhing a true and real <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity between God and Men. Thus far he, which is obſerved by Dr. <hi>Jer. Taylor</hi> in his Book, intitled <hi>The Real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and Spiritual of Chriſt in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> pag. 50.</p>
            <p>We alſo confeſs the neceſſity of this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, but by another way, which is plain, evident and comfortable, as it is deſcribed in this Book, as I truſt will appear to the Reader. So that no need will be of that <hi>Roman</hi> Subterfuge, and pretence of their horrid, unreaſonable and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible <hi>Mode</hi> by an Oral, groſs, carnal and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral Eating of his Fleſh, and Drinking his Blood, with which Impoſture, a great part of the Chriſtian World hath been a long time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed; but by the cool and ſober peruſal of this Diſcourſe, the Ingenuous <hi>Romaniſt</hi> may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily in ſome meaſure be undeceived.</p>
            <p>The moſt compleat and perfect <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of Chriſt with Man, conſiſteth in five things. 1. <hi>Carne,</hi> in Fleſh. 2. <hi>Anima,</hi> in Soul. 3. <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu,</hi> in Spirit. 4. <hi>Vadimonio,</hi> in Covenant or Suretyſhip. 5. <hi>Fide</hi> in Faith.</p>
            <p>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion which I ſhall chiefly endeavour to deſcribe in this Tractate, conſiſteth in the two firſt of theſe, which I firmly believe to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and meant in that Speech of Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 53. <hi>Except ye Eat the Fleſh of the Son of Man, and Drink his Blood,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>E that attempteth to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the grand myſtery of <hi>Eating and Drinking the Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt,</hi> muſt begin his Work very early, even at the Creation of our firſt Parents, or rather, before the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World. Becauſe, the moſt wiſe, mercifull, and juſt Godhead, had deſigned the redemption of Mankind from Eternity by <hi>God the Son:</hi> And did lay the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the frame, order, and method thereof in the firſt Man, and the firſt Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98443:14"/>
from whom every man and woman that are, were, or hereafter ſhall be born, with Chriſt himſelf alſo, have derived both their Fleſh, and their Souls, that ſo an Union and conjunction might be made of the Redeemer with the Redeemed; without which Union, the Son of God could not be fitly qualified to perform with <hi>Juſtice</hi> the great Work of Redemption of Mankind.</p>
               <p>Concerning this Union, thoſe words of Chriſt are to be underſtood. <hi>John</hi> 6. 53. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ye eat the fleſh of the Son of Man, and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 6. 53. Mat. 26. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>drink his blood;</hi> and thoſe other words <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 26. <hi>This is my Body,</hi> and <hi>This is my Blood;</hi> both muſt needs be true, becauſe <hi>Truth</hi> hath ſpoken them: The former were meant of the real, and ſubſtantial Union and conjunction of our fleſh with his Fleſh, and of our ſouls with his Soul; the latter were meant of the Repreſentation or ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of our true, real and ſubſtantial union with Chriſt, in his whole humane Nature, ſignified to us by the Sacramental eating and drinking of Bread and Wine, as it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore repreſented to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in eating the fleſh of the <hi>Paſchal Lamb.</hi> For as with them, and with us, The Lamb, and Bread and Wine, were really to be taken into our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and do really nouriſh us, and unite themſelves with our bodies, and grow into
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98443:14"/>
one bulk with us: So Chriſt with Mankind muſt be united, and be One with us, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he cannot with the <hi>ſtrictneſs of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Juſtice</hi> be the Redeemer of Mankind, neither could man be capable of redemption by him.</p>
               <p>Concerning the truth and reality of eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drinking the fleſh and blood of Chriſt the Redeemer; the <hi>Reformed Chruches,</hi> and alſo the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nreformed</hi> do both agree, and yet exceedingly differ, and diſagree in the manner, and way thereof.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Roman Tranſubſtantiators</hi> would have us believe, that Chriſt is eaten in the Sacrament, really; pretending, that the Bread and Wine are <hi>tranſubſtantiated,</hi> or rather <hi>annihilated;</hi> and that the whole Chriſt is brought into the room thereof, and ſo eaten.</p>
               <p>But this cannot be the <hi>mode,</hi> or way of eating Chriſt, becauſe the eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by him meant, muſt have been in all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and paſt Generations, and muſt ſtill ſtand firm and true, although the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or <hi>Euchariſt</hi> had never been inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; for <hi>Abraham, Iſaac, Jacob, Noah,</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf muſt have eaten ſo, as is here meant, elſe they could not be redeemed by Chriſt. And this Eating of Chriſt was true and real, before he was actually Born or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98443:15"/>
St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Our Fathers did eat the ſame meat, and drink of the ſame Rock that</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>followed, and that Rock was Chriſt;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they did eat Chriſt, ſo as he meant.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Lutheran Conſubſtantiators</hi> would have men believe, that the Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt literally underſtood, are really, carnally, and groſly received, in, and with the Sacramental bread and wine.</p>
               <p>But neither can this way be true, becauſe the Eating here meant muſt have been, and ſtill is, without the Sacrament thereof; for the fleſh of Chriſt is now, and hath been eaten by thoſe that never heard of, nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did receive, or communicate in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, for Children, Heathens, <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Jews,</hi> and the moſt profane Chriſtians, muſt have eaten Chriſt, otherwiſe they could have no poſſibility, or be in any capacity of Redemption: Yet the Scriptures, the primitive Fathers, and the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> do clearly declare, that the benefit of Redemption belongeth, and is offered to <note place="margin">God the Son hath redeemed me, and all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</note> the whole World, to all, and every Man and Woman, as our Church Catechiſm teacheth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Zuinglians,</hi> who are called <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarians,</hi> would have men believe thatf Eating the fleſh, and Drinking the blood o Chriſt, is meant only of receiving the ſigns,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98443:15"/>
figures or Sacraments thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> by bread and wine in the Euchariſt.</p>
               <p>But neither can this way be the right meaning thereof, becauſe we muſt truly, and really receive the very thing it ſelf; for we muſt corporally be united with the fleſh of Chriſt, and really, and truly muſt our Souls be united with the Soul of Chriſt, elſe no redemption can poſſibly be, either of our bodies, or of our Souls by him. <hi>Calvin</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe words, <hi>This is my Body;</hi> very tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Calvin. n</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 24.</note> affirmeth, <hi>Neque fallax eſt Chriſtus, qui vacuis figuris nos ludat—Mihi extra contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſiam eſt—Veritatem hic, cum ſuo ſigno con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctam eſſe.</hi> (1.) Chriſt did not delude us with empty figures, I doubt not at all, but that the truth was joyned with the ſign.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Church of <hi>England</hi> doth not (to my apprehenſion) clearly determine of the <hi>Modus,</hi> or manner of Eating the Fleſh, or drinking the blood of Chriſt, either in the Sacrament, or out of the Sacrament; yet thus far this Church proceedeth in the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Art. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig.</hi> 28.</note> of the holy Supper, and ſaith in the 28<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Article, that it is <hi>the Sacrament of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,</hi> juſt ſo as St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> had before written of the ſame thing in an Epiſtle to <hi>Coecilius,</hi> wherein he calleth the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Sacramentum Redemptionis;</hi> becauſe <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cyp.</hi> 2. <hi>epiſt.</hi> 3.</note> thereby, as by an holy ſign, we are taught
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98443:16"/>
the manner, way, and method uſed by Chriſt in the work of our Redemption.</p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>England</hi> again declareth in <hi>the Office of the Euchariſt,</hi> that the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and penitent Receivers do <hi>ſpiritually eat and drink the Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt, that they dwell in Chriſt, and Chriſt in them, that they be One with Chriſt, and Chriſt with them;</hi> the meaning is, that the holy Supper is the Sacrament, or myſterious ſign of our Union with the fleſh of Chriſt, and with the blood or Soul of Chriſt, juſt as both S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aug. in</hi> John 26. <hi>Anſel. in</hi> Mat. 26.</note> after him S. <hi>Anſelm</hi> called it <hi>Sacramentum <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitatis.</hi> (2.) The Sacrament of Union, and the very word <hi>Communion</hi> (as this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is called) ſignifieth the ſame. <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munio</hi> is all one with <hi>counio,</hi> or <hi>unio cum;</hi> becauſe the ſacramental Eating and Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing repreſenteth the Union, or conjunction of the fleſh, and ſoul of Chriſt with our fleſh and ſoul, without which neither our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, nor our Souls can be by him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed.</p>
               <p>I will not at preſent engage or meddle with the doctrine, or meaning of the words in the myſtery of the holy Supper of our Lord, which was but the ſign of the grand, and real myſtery of the Eating the fleſh of Chriſt, of which only I am now to treat, in relation to thoſe Words of Chriſt in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98443:16"/>
the 6. Chapter of St. <hi>John,</hi> before the Holy Supper was inſtituted, of which words, my purpoſe and earneſt endeavour is to find out, and to diſcover the meaning, and true ſenſe; and my hearty deſire and prayer, that my Labours herein may in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure conduce to an agreement between diſſenting Parties.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Roman,</hi> and alſo the Reformed Church-Writers, men of great wiſdom, Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and ſobriety, have ſpent their precious time and labours, ſomething (as I humbly conceive) beſides the matter, purpoſe and intent of thoſe words of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Romaniſts</hi> have laboured too much, to aſſert and prove a carnal, groſs and literate eating of the very fleſh of Chriſt orally; grounding their Doctrine of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation</hi> upon thoſe two Speeches of Chriſt before mentioned; but with ill ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, having ſo much been perplexed in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering and excuſing the impoſſibilities, and the unprofitableneſs of ſuch an Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they were forced to flie to the old Poetical refuge of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,</hi> whereof they ſay there are <hi>eleven</hi> in effecting their Tranſubſtantiation; we may ad a <hi>twelfth,</hi> which to me ſeemeth the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of all, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſo many wiſe, and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men ſhould profeſs and believe ſuch
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98443:17"/>
unneceſſary, and manifeſt impoſſibilities.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Writers of the reformed Church have imployed their time and labour in a negative way, principally in confuting the impoſſibility of that <hi>Roman</hi> Doctrine, and in proving that we do not Orally eat the very fleſh of Chriſt, for although they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that Speech of Chriſt to be true, when he ſaid, <hi>Except ye eat the Fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. yet they truly affirm, that they are not to be underſtood of a groſs, carnal, and oral Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; This negative Doctrine occaſioned a pretence to the adverſe Party, to accuſe them of an attempt to confute and gainſay the words of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Theſe practices on both ſides, I conceive, have bin the cauſe of hiding or obſcuring the moſt gracious, and comfortable doctrine of our Union with the body or fleſh of Chriſt; and conſequently of the doctrine of our Redemption by him, both of them being certainly implyed in thoſe words of Eating and Drinking.</p>
               <p>It is therefore to be wiſhed, that ſuch Learned men for the future, would imploy their ſtudies in a poſitive Way, in ſhewing how thoſe Myſterious Words of Chriſt are true, and to be rightly underſtood, rather than in a negative confutation of a wrong Senſe, which work ſolidly performed, would
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98443:17"/>
clear the darkneſs of that Myſtery, and be exceedingly comfortable to pious Souls, and evidently declare the Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs and Mercy of our ever Bleſſed Redeemer.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II.</head>
               <p>IN order to the opening of this Myſtery, we are firſt to enquire what our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer meant by thoſe words of <hi>Eating and Drinking my Fleſh and Blood,</hi> which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly are not to be underſtood <hi>literally,</hi> but <hi>figuratively.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Reader may obſerve, that the grand Myſteries of our Religion in the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, are repreſented and exemplified dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as under a cloud, or veiled with the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of Eating.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Tree of life in Paradiſe was plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be eaten of; it was the figure or type of Chriſt, who called himſelf <hi>a Tree,</hi> Luk. 23. 31. and <hi>a Vine,</hi> John 15. 5. and <hi>the Life,</hi> John 14. 16. and is called <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>The Tree of Life.</hi> The typical Tree was ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to preſerve and continue a worldy life, as Chriſt the ſubſtantial Tree to procure an Eternal, and heavenly Life.</p>
               <p>Although that Tree of life was permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Godhead to be eaten of by our
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98443:18"/>
firſt Parents, yet they never did eat of it, becauſe in the ſtate of their Innocency they perceived not any need thereof, being in a condition of <hi>not dying</hi> (as Divines ſay) <hi>Potuit</hi> Adam <hi>non mori;</hi> nor was any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady upon them, ſo as to need any medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine to cure them of any diſeaſe; But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, when by their tranſgreſſion they had incurred the curſe of <hi>Mortality,</hi> they were excluded from that Tree of life, <hi>leaſt they ſhould take of the Tree of Life, and live</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 22. Gen. 2. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>for ever;</hi> whereby the Commination of God ſhould have failed, who had ſaid, <hi>In the day that thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely die.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was another Tree in Paradiſe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Tree of Knowledge,</hi> of which the <note place="margin">Gen. 2. 9.</note> Man was forbidden to eat, although it is ſaid, that <hi>the Woman ſaw that the Tree was good for food, and pleaſant to the eye, and to be deſired to make one wiſe.</hi> So though they abſtained from the Tree permitted, yet <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 6.</note> they did eat of the Tree forbidden.</p>
               <p>The Tree of Life repreſented Chriſt, the Tree of knowledge repreſented the Law, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> very judiciouſly affirmeth and proveth. That law concerning the Tree, <note place="margin">Tert. adv. Judaeos.</note> was <hi>Primondialis Lex,</hi> the firſt Law that was impoſed on Man, and had been large enough (ſaith he) if it had been obeyed. <hi>Lex data</hi> Adae <hi>&amp;</hi> Aevae, <hi>eſt quaſi matrix omnium</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Id. ibid.</note>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:98443:18"/>
                  <hi>praeceptorum Dei quae pullularunt poſtea, data per</hi> Moſem; It was as the Womb, out of which ſprang the Ten Commandments gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by <hi>Moſes;</hi> and in that firſt Law, all thoſe Moral laws are couched and implied.</p>
               <p>As the <hi>Tree of Life</hi> ſignifieth Chriſt with all his Evangelical mercies; And the Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that Tree ſignified the Union, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction and inherence of Mankind in him: So the Tree of knowledge ſignified <hi>the Law</hi> with all its ſtrictneſs, rigour and penalties. And the forbidding to Eat of that Tree, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, that we ſhould not truſt to, or rely on it, or expect to obtain life by perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the law, or juſtification and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by the works thereof: This I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be the meaning of forbidding the Tree of knowledge, as relating to the Law; becauſe I find divers paſſages concerning the ſaid law, even in the Goſpel, which to me ſignifie the ſame, as <hi>by the works of the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>Law ſhall no fleſh be juſtified;</hi> and, <hi>The Law worketh Wrath;</hi> it is called alſo <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>The Ministration of death;</hi> and <hi>the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 7, 9.</note> 
                  <hi>of condemnation.</hi> Therefore we are to depend on, and feed and nouriſh our hope and faith, only by Chriſt, who is the only true <hi>Tree of Life,</hi> and not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide in the <hi>Law,</hi> becauſe we cannot poſſibly by our own ſelves perform it, nor by any
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98443:19"/>
other way, but only in, by, and through Chriſt, and this by that intereſt which we have in him, by our union with his Fleſh and Soul.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Manna (every one knows) ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified Chriſt. The eating of Manna ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the union of Manna with the Bodies, or fleſh of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> which was a type of the neceſſity of Mans union with the fleſh of the Redeemer.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Paſchal Lamb ſignified the Lamb of God; And the Eating thereof ſignified the conjunction or union of the fleſh of the Redeemer with the Redeemed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The legal Sacrifices, repreſented Chriſt to be ſacrificed on the Altar of the Croſs: And they were to be eaten, (except <hi>Holo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſts.)</hi> The eating of them ſignified mans union with the Antitype, that is Chriſt, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as that which we eat becomes one with us, it grows into one bulk with our bodies, and is united with us, and is animated with the ſame life and ſoul with our bodies, it lives, it dies, and is buried, and riſeth again with us, and continueth with us after the Reſurrection everlaſtingly; in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the fleſh of Chriſt is united with our fleſh, without which Union there can be no Redemption of us by him, nor indeed any reſurrection of our Bodies, nor Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98443:19"/>
of our Souls, more than of the bodies and ſouls of brute Creatures; (as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear hereafter) therefore Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">John 6.</note> 
                  <hi>ye eat the fleſh of the Son of Man,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>you have no life in you.</hi> And in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental ſign of this real Myſtery, he ſaid, <hi>Take, eat, this is my Body</hi> (that is) my <note place="margin">Mat. 26.</note> Body is to you ſuch a thing, as this Bread which you eat is to be; which will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated and joyned in One, and united with your bodies, and will be animated with the ſame life and ſoul, wherewith all the parts of your body were formerly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued and informed.</p>
               <p>If it be enquired, why the very indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual fleſh of Chriſt ſhould not be in truth, and reality, and propriety of ſpeech con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to be eaten, in full correſpondence with the Type, <hi>viz.</hi> the fleſh of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal Lamb, which was really eaten?</p>
               <p>Our Anſwer is, That if there were no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, or ſignification of Eating the fleſh of Chriſt, but only <hi>Orally;</hi> or as the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſoundeth; then of neceſſity, it muſt be ſo meant and underſtood, and muſt be ſo eaten, as the Paſchal Lamb and the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices were. But there is another way and meaning thereof, wherein the fleſh of Chriſt is truly ſaid to be eaten, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was incarnate or born, and alſo
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98443:20"/>
after his Aſcenſion into Heaven, in both which times it was, and is, impoſſible to be <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 3.</note> eaten Orally.</p>
               <p>For when his Diſciples were offended at the mentioning of Eating his Fleſh, he ſaid, <hi>What and if you ſhall ſee the Son of man aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 6. 62</note> 
                  <hi>up where he was before?</hi> as if he had ſaid, my fleſh muſt have been eaten, ſo as I mean, even before I took human fleſh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me. And alſo, after my aſſumed fleſh ſhall be aſcended locally into Heaven, and not be any more upon Earth, or out of Heaven untill my return at the laſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and therefore far out of the reach of any mortal hand or mouth; therefore it cannot be meant literally of any oral, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> groſs carnal Eating.</p>
               <p>If we ſhall reſt ſatisfied, and ſeek no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into this Myſterious Eating, than only to believe, that Chriſt doth daily in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament thereof vouchſafe, and condeſcend to exhibit his very true Body in, or under the <hi>ſpecies</hi> or appearance of Bread, or Wafer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cakes, and that his very Body is ſo, really ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtant in many thouſand diſtant places in the ſame minute of time; which to human Reaſon is incredible, and contrary to Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, and even to our ſenſes: If we can ſwallow this vain, impoſſible and unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Camel, it would be a quick expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98443:20"/>
and an eaſie or lazy gloſs to unriddle this grand myſtery by; which hath a long time perplexed, and poſed the Chriſtian World.</p>
               <p>Concerning which, (good Chriſtian Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) I do here tender my poor Meditations, in humility, not <hi>Magiſterially;</hi> but with due ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the judgment of my Superiors; moſt earneſtly begging of God, inſtruction, il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination, and a right underſtanding here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and wholly truſting and relying upon him, who by his <hi>Apoſtle</hi> hath thus direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and promiſed, that, <hi>If any want wiſdom,</hi>

               <p>It is a very mean conceit, and a low gloſs of ſome late Expoſitors, put upon that myſterious Viſion of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> by which was ſignified the calling of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to the Goſpel.

This Expoſition is evidently confirmed by St. <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf, for after this Viſion, he went forthwith to <hi>Cornelius</hi> a <hi>Roman and Gentile,</hi> he preached Chriſt to him, and converted him, and baptized him, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98443:23"/>
thereby received, and incorporated him in the Corporation of the Church.</p>
               <p>The Eating of the fleſh of Chriſt in thoſe myſterious words of Chriſt, is in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to be underſtood, ſo as to ſignifie an <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>
                  <hi>Peter</hi> did not Orally eat the Nations, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it required by thoſe words, that we ſhould Orally eat the fleſh of Chriſt; what frantick <hi>Fanatick</hi> will ſo underſtand thoſe word of Chriſt? <hi>If thy right hand of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend</hi>

               <p>From the grounds and reaſons premiſed, my Concluſion is, and ever will be, that the Eating of the fleſh of Chriſt is meant, and to be underſtood only of the union or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of our fleſh with his Fleſh, or our <hi>concarnation</hi> with him, ſo as to be <hi>fleſh of his Fleſh,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith; without <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 30.</note>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:98443:24"/>
which Union there will be no poſſibility of Redemption of our bodies by the bitter paſſions, and death of his bleſſed Body. But how this conjunction, and union of his Body, and our bodies was contrived and effected, is next to be enquired.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV.</head>
               <p>IT is certainly neceſſary for our Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, and in order thereto, that firſt there muſt be a true, real, and corporal union, or conjunction of our fleſh with the Fleſh of our Redeemer; which corporal union was contrived and effected by the moſt Wiſe, Juſt, and Mercifull Godhead, and was by him deſigned, and plotted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Creation, on purpoſe to put Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind into a capacity of Redemption, his Providence foreſeeing the fall of Man, and his goodneſs and mercy providing the cure of <hi>Redeemableneſs</hi> by God the Son, to be in time <hi>coincarnate</hi> with us, and to become <hi>Emanuel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For if it may appear, that the fleſh or body of Chriſt was made of the ſame Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials of which our fleſh and bodies are made, and if both he and we, have derived our
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98443:24"/>
Fleſh from the ſelf-ſame lump of the firſt Man, who then can deny an Union, and conjunction of him with us in that firſt Lump?</p>
               <p>The firſt Man was made of a piece of Earth, and the firſt Woman was derived out of the Man, and not made of another piece of Earth; for the Woman could not have been in union with Chriſt, except ſhe had been taken out of the Man, as Chriſt, and all Mankind are; nor could ſhe, or we have been capable of Redemption by Chriſt, without this union with Chriſt in the firſt Man.</p>
               <p>Hence it is that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>We are Members of his Body, of his Fleſh, and of his</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Proſp. ad Cap.

               <p>In the Old Teſtament, where we read of <hi>Filius Hominis,</hi> or Son of Man, the ſame words in the Original are <hi>Ben-Adam</hi> often.

               <p>IN the next place we are to enquire, what was the Doctrine of the Fathers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Body of Chriſt,</hi> and alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Union of the Head with the members thereof.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Body of Chriſt in Scripture hath a double ſignification. 1. It ſignifieth the <hi>natural,</hi> proper and individual, or perſonal Body of Chriſt, of which it is ſaid, <hi>a woman poured ointment on his Body,</hi> and Joſeph <hi>beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Body of Chriſt ſignifieth his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Myſtical,</hi> that is, the whole Corporation of Chriſt and his Members, of which it is ſaid, <hi>He is the Head of his body the Church.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Col. 1. 18</note>
               </p>
               <p>Chriſts <hi>Natural body</hi> is but a part of his <hi>Myſtical body,</hi> as our head is but a part of our natural body. And as the head, and other parts of our natural body are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98443:27"/>
united; ſo Chriſt, and all his Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are united, and joyned by an inviſible Tie or knot, both in Fleſh and Soul, as will hereafter appear, as alſo in one <hi>Spirit,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from Chriſt the Head, and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating it ſelf to every particular member of that great Myſtical Body; as it is ſaid of the <hi>precious Ointment upon the Head,</hi>

               <p>In conſideration of this Union, by thoſe three knots or ligaments juſt now mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the Fathers looked on Chriſt and his Members, and conſidered them ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as upon one Body, or one Man, or one univerſal Perſon, becauſe there is no one man or woman in the World whoſe nature Chriſt hath not aſſumed, whereof St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> ſaith, <hi>In Chriſto ſumma univerſalitatis</hi>

                  </gap>, the Parent or Mother of God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To this we anſwer. <hi>Firſt.</hi> That the Son of God (conſidered only and ſingly, as the Son of God in his pure Godhead, and only as <hi>God the Word,</hi> and as he was <hi>in the form of God</hi> only, and without Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) could not be our Redeemer, and if he had continued ſo, as to be only the <hi>Son</hi>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:98443:29"/>
                  <hi>of God,</hi> as he was from Eternity, and had never taken our human Nature upon him, ſo as to be thereby really <hi>the Son of Man,</hi> he could not be the Chriſt, neither could any obligation, or engagement have been upon him to perform the Law, which Law was impoſed only upon Mankind; neither could he have redeemed us, becauſe he could not die, being not mortal, otherwiſe then by aſſuming our <hi>Mortal</hi> nature, into Perſonal union with his <hi>Immortal and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature:</hi> Therefore in order to the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Redeemer, he muſt become a Man, and his fleſh muſt needs be <hi>the fleſh of the Son of Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly.</hi> We ſay, That although the Son of God had really aſſumed a body and fleſh ſome other way, and not from Man or Woman, as ſometimes he did in the days of the Patriarchs in the Old Teſtament, as namely, when he appeared to Jacob, of which it is ſaid, <hi>There wreſtled a Man with</hi>

                  <hi>him, and pulled off his ſhoes from his feet,</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> was commanded before by God. Surely this was an apparition of God the

Son, in the aſſumed body and ſhape of Man, who appeared moſt evidently before to the Patriarch <hi>Abraham,</hi> of whom it is written, that <hi>the Lord appeared to</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <note place="margin">Gen. 18.</note>

                  <hi>tunc apud</hi> Abraham <hi>in veritate quidem apparuit, ſed nondum natae, quia nondum mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riturae,</hi> Chriſt with the other two Angels, did verily appear at <hi>Abrahams</hi> Tent in true, and real fleſh; yet not in fleſh born, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from Mankind, becauſe he was not to ſuffer or die in that Fleſh. Therefore he could not (by reaſon of that aſſumed fleſh) be called <hi>the Son of Man,</hi> although he was like to a real Son of Man, and but only like; and if the Son of God had ſtill retained, and continued in that aſſumed body or fleſh, in which he then prefented himſelf to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and had not taken his human Nature otherwiſe, from his Virgin Mother, and ſo from the firſt
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98443:30"/>
Man, he could not have been our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.</p>
               <p>Such another apparition we find in the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> who in his Viſion, <hi>ſaw one like the Son of Man, who came with the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Dan. 7. 13</note> 
                  <hi>clouds of Heaven.</hi> This was meant of the <hi>Son of God,</hi> who in <hi>Daniels</hi> time was not <hi>the Son of Man,</hi> or <hi>Ben-David,</hi> being then not incarnate of the Virgin; and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaid to be only <hi>like the Son of Man,</hi> or as it is ſaid in another place of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>One like the ſimilitude of the Sons of men;</hi> and <hi>One like the appearance of the Sons</hi>

                  <hi>of Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the <hi>Redeemer</hi> muſt be not in ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude or appearance only, but truly, and really the <hi>Son of Man,</hi> before he could be compleatly qualified for our Redeemer; becauſe the Redeemer, and the Redeemed, muſt be neceſſarily united in fleſh mutual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and muſt be conſidered and looked on by <hi>Divine</hi> Juſtice, as if they were but one man, or one Perſon, which was wrought and performed by the union of Chriſt with all Mankind in the loins of <hi>Adam,</hi> from whom all our bodies and ſouls are derived.</p>

               </p>
               <p>From whence we may obſerve, that <hi>Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Fleſh of Chriſt,</hi> in their ſenſe, or by their Interpretation at leaſt, is not to be underſtood of any preſent <hi>Oral Eating,</hi> or if it were to be done only in the future, or in the preſent Euchariſt, or as if it were not already done; for the Eating here meant, is intended generally by all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and not only by <hi>holy Men,</hi> as <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Patriarchs, Apoſtles, Iſraelites or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians;</hi> but alſo by <hi>Infidels,</hi> by <hi>Pagans, Turks, Athieſts,</hi> and the very worſt of all <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,</hi> by ſuch as never heard of Chriſt, and thoſe that never received the Sacrament of the Body of Chriſt, or ſo much as once heard of it, and moreover by ſuch as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed it; nor is <hi>Cain</hi> or <hi>Judas</hi> (the worſt of both Teſtaments) excluded from this Eating of the fleſh of Chriſt, ſo as it here ſignifieth, becauſe they were redeemed by him.</p>
               <p>My reaſon for this Aſſertion is, becauſe I firmly believe, that this <hi>Eating</hi> ſignifieth only the <hi>

               <p>The time when Man doth thus <hi>Eat the fleſh of the Son of Man,</hi> that is, when our fleſh is united with the Fleſh of Chriſt, is at our <hi>Conception</hi> in the Womb; for then

               <p>IT being granted, that our fleſh and the Fleſh of Chriſt are ſo united or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twined, and mingled one with the other, as is ſaid; it may be enquired what vertue, or efficacy hath the Fleſh of Chriſt, more than the fleſh of the <hi>Patriarks, Prophets and Apoſtles?</hi> with whom we are as really united in the firſt Man, as we are with Chriſt; for we know that the fleſh of Chriſt is a Creature, and ſo is the fleſh of thoſe who all deſcended from <hi>Adam,</hi> as Chriſt did.</p>
               <p>To this Query we anſwer and grant, that the fleſh, or body of Chriſt was, and ſtill is a Creature, for <hi>he took upon him the</hi>

                  <hi>Word was God,</hi> therefore Chriſt is called <hi>God manifested in the fleſh,</hi> and of him it is ſaid, that <hi>God ſent his Son in the likeneſs of ſinfull Fleſh.</hi> The fleſh which the Son of God aſſumed, was true and real Fleſh, yet not ſinfull fleſh, but only in ſimilitude, <hi>viz.</hi> like to the fleſh of other Men which is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: This Son of God by Incarnation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made the Son of Man, is called <hi>Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel,</hi>

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:98443:44"/>
abhor the Dream of <hi>Tranſubſtantiators</hi> of a groſs, carnal, and Oral eating, have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived another way, which they call <hi>Eating Spiritually;</hi> which word is uſed in this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> declaring to the penitent and faithfull Communicants, that <hi>They Spiritually eat the Fleſh of Chriſt, and drink his Blood, They dwell in Chriſt, and Chriſt in them, They be One with Chriſt, and Chriſt with them,</hi> which is true.</p>
               <p>By thoſe words of <hi>Dwelling in Chriſt, and being One with him, and Eating his Fleſh,</hi> this Church declareth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, a true and real Union of our fleſh with his very Fleſh, although ſhe utterly denieth the groſs and Oral eating, and tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Fleſh.</p>

So we are now to enquire, what is meant by the Eating the fleſh of Chriſt ſpiritually.</p>
               <p>To this we Anſwer, That this word <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually</hi> hath a double ſignification, for <note place="margin">

Spirit of our Lord Jeſus, by which we are united with him; becauſe the ſame Spirit which is in Jeſus, is from him the Head de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, and communicated to his Members. Of this Union of the Spirit, or ſpiritual U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of us with Chriſt, the great Apoſtle often ſpeaketh, <hi>He that is joyned to the Lord,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 17. 12. 13. Eph. 4. 4.</note>

               <p>But this <hi>Spiritual <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> or Union in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, although it is true and real, yet this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone may not be thought to be ſo plenary, or ſo ſufficient an Union, as is neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired for expediting that great Work, for which the Bleſſed Godhead deſigned Mans Union with Chriſt, as may appear by the Reaſons following.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt.</hi> If to eat <hi>Spiritually,</hi> ſhould ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifie to receive the Spirit of Chriſt only, and no more, and be only ſo by us apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, utterly diſowning the eating, or the real Union of his Fleſh with our fleſh, in truth and reality; we ſhall thereby diſturb and null the Order of the grand, and mercifull work of Redemption, which could not be wrought, only by an union or conjunction
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:98443:45"/>
of the Spirit of the Son of God with us, but alſo with the Union of his bleſſed Fleſh and Blood with our fleſh and blood, becauſe the Spirit alone is not a Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; for the Spirit could not ſuffer, and die for us as a Redeemer muſt, it was the vital blood and death of the Redeemer, that was neceſſarily required for Mans Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly.</hi> The <hi>Son of God</hi> (as only ſo) was a Spirit from Eternity (for God is a Spirit.) But if the Son of God will vouchſafe to become a Redeemer, he muſt needs be firſt <hi>the Son of Man,</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel,</hi> as the Church in her Hymn confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, <hi>When thou tookeſt upon thee to deliver Man, thou didſt not abhorr the Virgins Womb.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For if <hi>God the Son,</hi> or God the Word, had ſo continued in his pure Divinity, and had not aſſumed our Human nature, ſo as to be the <hi>Son of Man,</hi> and <hi>the Word made Fleſh,</hi> he could not have been <hi>Chriſt,</hi> nor <hi>Jeſus,</hi> nor <hi>Prieſt,</hi> nor <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> nor <hi>Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;</hi> for otherwiſe, we might as well ſay, that the Perſon of the Father, or the Perſon of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> were our Redeemers, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though neither of thoſe Perſons aſſumed our nature, as <hi>Auſtin,</hi> or rather <hi>Gennadius</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, <note place="margin">

                  <hi>natura non eſt Redemptrix, quia pati non po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuit,</hi> the pure and ſingle Divine nature could not be the Redeemer, becauſe it could not ſuffer or die. And we know that Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption was confined and limited, ſo as to be only by the <hi>Seed of the Woman;</hi> but the Spirit, or Holy Ghoſt is not the Seed of the Woman, therefore <hi>God the Son</hi> took on him that Seed, and that form of a Servant, and therein he became our Redeemer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thereby he became Mortal, and could ſuffer and die.</p>
               <p>Neither could the human Nature of Chriſt, conſidered ſingly and alone, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Divine Nature, and by it ſelf only have redeemed us, becauſe no meer Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture could poſſibly be of ſufficient worth to ranſom the World, or to ſatisfie Divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice for the ſins of Mankind.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third Reaſon is, That other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures (beſides Mankind) have the Spirit of God (which is the ſame Spirit with the Spirit of Chriſt) yet thoſe other creatures have no benefit by the Incarnation and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſt. For the bleſſed Angels are plentifully endowed with the Spirit, yet becauſe they are not united with the fleſh and blood of Chriſt, they cannot be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:98443:46"/>
of any benefit thereby, or of Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption (if need were) more than the evil, or Apoſtate Angels are; becauſe the Son of God dit not <hi>aſſume the nature of Angels,</hi> nor <note place="margin">Heb. 2. 16.</note> did any Angels aſſume the nature of Man. Beſides, other inferiour Creatures are not deſtitute of the Spirit of God, which is ſaid to <hi>fill Heaven and Earth.</hi> The Pſalmiſt <note place="margin">Jer. 23. 24. Pſ. 139. 6 Joel 2. 28</note> could not tell, <hi>whether he ſhould go from the Spirit,</hi> and God by his Prophet had ſaid, <hi>I will pour out my Spirit upon all fleſh,</hi> which is truly performed, not only on Mankind, but alſo on other inferiour Creatures; for by the vertue and vigour of the Spirit, <hi>they live, and move, and have their being;</hi> yet <note place="margin">Acts 17. 28.</note> they are not thereby capable of the benefits or effects which come by the Incarnation, becauſe they are not ſo united with Chriſt as our Nature is. For theſe reaſons I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it may appear, that the Eating, or the Union with the Fleſh of Chriſt, is not meant of Receiving only the Spirit, or of eating his Fleſh ſpiritually, in that ſenſe which is aboveſaid.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly.</hi> Thoſe words of <hi>Eating ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually,</hi> in the ſenſe of the Church I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to ſignifie ſuch a kind of Eating, as is diſtinct and different from the literal or Grammatical ſignification thereof, and from any groſs, carnal or Oral eating; and that
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:98443:47"/>
it ſignifieth to Eat according to the Spirit, that is, according to the intent, purpoſe and true inward meaning and ſenſe of the Spirit. For we know that the word <hi>Spirit,</hi> in Scripture is often oppoſed to the word <hi>Letter,</hi> as may appear by thoſe words of St. <hi>Paul, God hath made us able Miniſters of the</hi>

               <p>If now it be granted, that St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> did intend thoſe words to ſignifie ſo as is above ſaid, then they will amount no farther than this which to me ſeemeth a true gloſs, and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:98443:50"/>
as much as if he had ſaid, think it not need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to prepare thy mouth to eat the Fleſh of Chriſt, for, <hi>Crede &amp; manducaſti,</hi> thou haſt ſo eaten his Fleſh already, as he meant, by being united with him in the very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception: only <hi>believe in him,</hi> and thereby that <hi>Eating</hi> or <hi>

               <p>The Wiſdom of the Godhead, with <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Mercy</hi> deſigned this our Union with the fleſh of <hi>God the Son,</hi> on purpoſe to qualifie and prepare our <hi>foreſeen lapſed Nature,</hi> ſo, as by this way to put Mankind into a condition, and capacity of Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mableneſs, and ſo of Salvation poſſibly, which could not otherwiſe be conſiſtent with <hi>Divine Juſtice;</hi> as neither could it become his <hi>Mercy</hi> to have created Mankind, on purpoſe to torment us for ever in Hell.

                  <hi>ſinner;</hi> therefore hath he ſet us into this way, and poſſibility of Life.</p>
               <p>For the Nature of Mankind hath been in three ſeveral conditions, which Divines
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:98443:50"/>
expreſs by theſe three words. 1. <hi>Natura Inſtituta.</hi> 2. <hi>Natura Deſtituta.</hi> 3. <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra Reſtituta.</hi> By which they mean the ſtate of Innocency, the ſtate of our Fall, and the ſtate of our Recovery by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The firſt was, whilſt our firſt Parents (who were created pure and holy) conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in that Original Integrity without ſin.</p>
               <p>The ſecond was after their Fall or Sin, by which they became deſtitute, and were deprived of their prime Graces and Purity, and we by them.</p>
               <p>The third condition, is our reſtitution to Grace and Pardonableneſs by Chriſt, who being <hi>the Son of God,</hi> to effect this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, became <hi>the Son of Man,</hi> by aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame Nature which we have; and in that Nature perfectly performed that Law of God (which was impoſed upon us) in our behalf, and for us, and moreover bare in his own Body the puniſhments due for the ſins of our lapſed Nature.</p>
               <p>All the wiſdom of Men and Angels could not find out a way, whereby lapſed Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind could with juſtice be reſtored; but the mercifull Godhead effected it by <hi>God the Son,</hi> to become <hi>Emanuel;</hi> this was <hi>the Lords doing</hi> only.</p>
               <p>Or if any creature had known, or diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:98443:51"/>
the ſame means; what Man or Angel, or Archangel, durſt preſume to have ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted it to the Godhead, ſo as to ſay, Thou O God haſt impoſed a Law on man, which, Mankind by all its own power (being lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed) cannot poſſibly perform. And thou haſt threatned death for tranſgreſſion thereof, which no Man poſſibly by himſelf can eſcape; therefore do thou O God, thine own ſelf perform thine own Law, and to this end abaſe thy ſelf, and aſſume mans Nature on thee, and ſuffer the puniſhment due to Man; for otherwiſe, the whole Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Mankind muſt periſh everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. How unlikely, or rather impoſſible would this ſuggeſtion ſeem to any Creature ever to take effect?</p>
               <p>Yet the mercifull Godhead in great pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and wiſdom, did juſt ſo perform that great Work. Well might St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, <hi>We preach Chriſt crucified, the Power of God, and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 23, 24.</note> 
                  <hi>the Wiſdome of God;</hi> Chriſt ſignifieth God, yet not only his pure Godhead, but as God is Incarnate, and made Man. The Wiſdom of his Godhead appointed this way of ranſoming the whole World from death, by the death of <hi>one Man;</hi> and the Power of his Godhead enabled and impowred <hi>one Man</hi> to perform that Work with full ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to Divine Juſtice. When Chriſt had
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:98443:51"/>
miraculouſly cured a <hi>Paralitick;</hi> St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> tells us, that <hi>the multitude glorified God,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Thus far we have proceeded in ſhewing the <hi>Modus</hi> or way, which we conceive of the Eating the fleſh of Chriſt; If this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition be approved (which is eaſily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood) it will quit us from the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of <hi>impoſſibilities,</hi> and the <hi>Labyrinth</hi> of ſubtilties and intricacies, wherein that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> hath entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled many Learned men; for mine own part I am perſuaded, that if this way (which I have here deſcribed) be ſlighted, we ſhall never by any other way attain to any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, or but probable underſtanding of this Myſtery.</p>
               <p>In the next place (by Gods aſſiſtance) we will endeavour to diſcover the other part, and more difficult Myſtery, which is called <hi>the Drinking of the Blood of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My whole Deſign (Good Reader) in the former Chapters of this Book, was to ſhew and prove <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> of our fleſh or bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, with the Fleſh or Body of Chriſt, as

                  </p>
                  <p>For the word <hi>Blood,</hi> hath a more high and noble ſignification in that ſpeech of Chriſt, than the outward and literal ſound expreſſeth; for to drink his Blood, literal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and groſly underſtood, is as impoſſible
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:98443:52"/>
as unprofitable for us, as hath been before ſhewed of the Oral eating of his Fleſh.</p>

the ſtock of his Blood needed to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully husbanded, for if at this day his Blood were literally, and orally to be received by Communicants, how many Tunn of blood would be ſufficient to Communicate the whole Chriſtian World?

                  <p>Secondly, Becauſe Blood was forbidden in the New Teſtament, by that holy and unerring Council of the Apoſtles, aſſiſted by the Spirit of their Maſter Jeſus, <hi>It ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi>

Fourthly, If it were poſſible for us Men, now to drink the very Blood of Chriſt, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and literally underſtood, it could not in the leaſt advantage us in order to our Redemption, becauſe it was not the meer Blood of Chriſt literally taken; that was the price of our Redemption (although one drop of his precious Blood was worth more than the whole World) for he ſhed his Blood at his <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> but that Blood was not Redemptive; ſuppoſe he had <hi>ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a vein,</hi> and preſented or offered that Blood, yet this could not have redeemed us; neither could that Blood, which iſſued out of his Body in <hi>Agony</hi> and <hi>bloody Sweat,</hi> or at his <hi>Scourging</hi> or <hi>Crowning with thorns,</hi> or that at the <hi>piercing of his Hands and Feet;</hi> all theſe Bloodſheddings together could not redeem Mankind, but the Blood of Chriſt, which was really redemptive, was his <hi>Vital Blood,</hi> whereof the words of St. <hi>Peter</hi> are rightly to be underſtood: <hi>Ye know that ye were not redeemed with corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible</hi>

               <p>THe Law of abſtaining from Blood was enacted by God, in a typical refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Blood of Chriſt, which was to be ſhed in after times upon the altar of the Croſs, for Expiation of the ſins of Mankind, which Expiation was (before the death of Chriſt) typically repreſented by the death and blood of <hi>certain Creatures</hi> appointed by God, whereby the legal or ceremonial <hi>Atonement</hi> was to be performed, for which purpoſe God did except, and reſerve the blood of thoſe Sacrifical Creatures from being eaten by Men, which reaſon is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by God himſelf evidently (as to me ſeemeth) in theſe words, <hi>I will ſet my face againſt that Soul that eateth Blood, and</hi>

                  <hi>will cut him off from among his People, for the life of the fleſh is the Blood, and I have given it to you upon the Altar, to make an atonement for your Souls, for it is the Blood that maketh an Atonement for the Souls,</hi> this was the law for the Blood of the Sacrifical Creatures.</p>
               <p>And as for the blood of other Creatures which were profane, and not to be uſed for Sacrifices, their blood was alſo <hi>forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:98443:56"/>
                  <hi>to be eaten by Men,</hi> but by another Law <note place="margin">Lev. 17. 13.

               <p>But then we are to enquire, what moved <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Quest. </seg>
                  </label> the <hi>Apoſtolical Council</hi> to revive that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quated law of abſtaining from Blood, more than the other Ceremorials, of <hi>Sacrifices, Circumciſion, Paſchal Lamb, Sabbatizings,</hi> &amp;c. And why they impoſed this <hi>Decree</hi> or <hi>Canon</hi> upon the converted <hi>Gentiles?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. To this we anſwer. Firſt, That the <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> Apoſtles, directed by the Holy Ghoſt, did impoſe this Abſtinence on the converted <hi>Gentiles</hi> in the Pedagogy of the Church, on purpoſe for compliance with the convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Jews,</hi> leaſt they ſhould be ſoandalized or offended with Chriſtianity it ſelf, when they ſhould ſee Chriſtians <hi>eating Blood,</hi> from which, themſelves in the time of their <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daiſm,</hi> were by their law debarred, and could not ſuddenly be withdrawn from ſo old a Cuſtom, untill they were more fully inſtructed in Chriſtian Religion; for it might ſeem to them a diſparagement, and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:98443:56"/>
a contempt of <hi>Moſes</hi> and his Laws: which reaſon is intimated by St. <hi>James,</hi> in that he ſaid, <hi>Moſes is read in the Synagogues eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Acts 15. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> which he ſpake in that very Council; ſo we our ſelves at our Tables, forbear the ſetting on of certain meats, which our ſelves like, becauſe they would be offenſive to ſome of our invited Gueſts, as Swines fleſh, Cheeſe, and ſuch like. Yet this Diſcipline of abſtaining from Blood, was not intended to be a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and ſtanding Law in Chriſtianity, but only a temporary Ordinance, and to laſt no longer than there was danger apparent, of occaſioning a Schiſm, or Diviſion between the Converted <hi>Jews,</hi> and the Chriſtian Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This Diſcipline did as well become the mildneſs of Chriſtianity, as that old Law did the Religion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they were reſtrained from uſing ſuch cruelties to Creatures, as poſſibly might be practiſed by Eating ſome parts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Beaſts, whilſt other parts were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved alive; which kind of cruelty was acted by the <hi>Romans</hi> upon the bodies of the captive <hi>Jews,</hi> at the laſt deſtruction of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> when they were condemned to be devoured by Lions, or other Beaſts, and were ſo cruelly uſed by the Beaſt-maſters,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:98443:57"/>
that as <hi>Joſephus</hi> reported, one half of their <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Joſ. de Bello Ju. Lib.</hi> 7.</note> bodies were eaten, and the other half kept alive in warm blood, for a ſecond meal for the Beaſts.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This Diſcipline was needfull in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, eſpecially in thoſe primitive times of Perſecution, to confute thoſe calumnies and falſe accuſations, which the Heathens, and Perſecutors raiſed againſt Chriſtians of their <hi>Thyeſtean Feaſts;</hi> as if in their Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they had uſed to Eat the fleſh and blood of Children, which they had for that uſe murthered, which thing the Chriſtians abhorred, and to ſhew that they were far from any ſuch bloody practices (by dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of that Apoſtolical Canon) they ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained even from the blood of Beaſts, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the whole time of the Perſecutions.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That Diſcipline which was intended to continue but for the aboveſaid time, is needfull, and of great concernment to be ſeriouſly conſidered and pondered in theſe times, as a clear evidence againſt the ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>univerſal deluge of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> whereby the Eating and Drinking of the living fleſh and blood of Chriſt, is ſo fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and pertinaciouſly maintained, although the Apoſtles who forbad Blood, certainly in thoſe very times did often communicate in the Sacrament of the Blood of Chriſt:
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:98443:57"/>
Therefore they did not think that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be turned into blood, nor did they in the leaſt believe that Doctrine thereof, which is now taught; they did really and orally drink <hi>the blood of the grape,</hi> but in no wiſe orally <hi>the Blood of Christ. Porpherie</hi> ſometime a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>We ſhould in the next place enquire, what Chriſt meant by thoſe words of <hi>drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his Blood</hi> which he ſpake, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Euchariſtical Sacrament was ſet up, and alſo at the Inſtitution thereof, which we muſt reſpit for a little time, untill we have cleared ſome Queſtions concerning the Apoſtolical Decree againſt Blood, which I have ſaid was but a <hi>Temporary Canon,</hi> at leaſt in part.</p>
               <p>In that Council, and in their Reſcript to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> three things are forbidden. 1. <hi>Idol-meats.</hi> 2. <hi>Blood.</hi> 3. <hi>Fornication,</hi> in theſe words, <hi>That ye abſtain</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Acts 15. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>from meats offered to Idols, and from Blood, and from Fornication</hi> (for thoſe other words, <hi>things Strangled,</hi> are implied in the word Blood.)</p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe three we are well aſſured,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:98443:58"/>
was but <hi>Temporary,</hi> becauſe S. <hi>Paul</hi> did ſoon after permit the eating of Meats brought from the <hi>Shambles,</hi> although they had been offered to Idols, as the common cuſtom of the Gentile-Idolaters was in thoſe times; and alſo, although the Chriſtians did know, that thoſe meats had been offered to Idols; only in caſe any Chriſtian Brother ſhould take offence thereat, then he adviſeth to abſtain, ſaying, <hi>whatſoever is ſold in the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>Shambles eat, asking no queſtion for conſcience ſake;</hi> and though they are <hi>bid to a feaſt by an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbeliever,</hi> yet <hi>eat; But if any man</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">27. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>ſhall ſay unto you, this is offered unto Idols, eat not for his ſake that ſhewed it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond concerning <hi>Blood,</hi> was alſo Temporary, for the reaſons above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
               <p>The third concerning <hi>Fornication</hi> was not Temporary, for it was forbidden by the <hi>7th.</hi> Precept of the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> and by the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. 29. <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. 17. and by the Goſpel often. <hi>Neither Fornicators nor Adulterers,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſhall inherit the Kingdom of God;</hi> and, <hi>Whoremongers</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 9, 18. Heb. 13. 4 Eph. 5. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>and Adulterers God will judge,</hi> by which laws, both <hi>Jews</hi> and Chriſtians were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, and alſo the very <hi>Heathens</hi> by the <hi>Law moral,</hi> although they took no notice thereof; therefore this law againſt Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation

was in force before that Council ſate, and will ſo continue, as long as the World endures.</p>
               <p>But then our Queſtion muſt be, why it pleaſed that Council to impoſe that <hi>Canon</hi>

               <p>IT will not (I ſuppoſe) be denied, that the Apoſtolical Council did forbid the Eating of Blood, ſo as is ſaid; And that the Apoſtles, and the Converted <hi>Jews,</hi> and the Chriſtian <hi>Gentiles,</hi> did abſtain from blood by vertue of this Decree; Add yet (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that Apoſtolical Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) the Apoſtles themſelves, and other Chriſtians did drink the Blood of Chriſt, in that ſenſe which Himſelf meant before the Sacrament, <hi>John</hi> 6.

of which he ſaid, <hi>This is my Blood,</hi> and, <hi>Drink ye all of this.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All this being true and confeſſed, we are next to enquire diligently, what our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer meant by this word <hi>Blood,</hi> which certainly did not ſignifie his own very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Blood, literally and grammatically ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; but ſome other thing, which for ſome weighty reaſon he was pleaſed to call <hi>Blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That other thing which he meant by Blood, we confidently affirm to be <hi>his Soul,</hi> his Human or reaſonable Soul, and this we doubt not to make clear and apparent (with Gods Aſſiſtance) by the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, becauſe we find by many overtures and plain expreſſions, that the <hi>Life or Soul</hi> in Holy Writ, by the Mouth of God is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the Creation of Man, God appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo to the Ante-diluvian Patriarks for their food, only the <hi>herbs bearing ſeed, and every tree, in which is the</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The Blood (we ſee) is there called <hi>Life,</hi> although we know that <hi>Blood</hi> in propriety of ſpeech, is not the <hi>Life or Soul</hi> of Man or Beaſt, but only ſignifieth the <hi>Life or Soul;</hi> for one may looſe ſome Blood by a wound, or otherwiſe, yet the life may continue, and becauſe the Soul it ſelf is inviſible, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that which is viſible is named for the Soul; and becauſe the blood is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, and alſo the chariot of the Soul, and becauſe the letting out, or ſpilling the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal blood, carrieth out with it the life and Soul, therefore God preſently after called Mans Blood, <hi>the Blood of our lives, which</hi>

               <p>THat the Blood of Chriſt (in thoſe words) ſignifieth the human Soul of Chriſt, I nothing doubt, and to drink his
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:98443:62"/>
Soul orally, is as impoſſible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as it is for us to drink his Blood literally taken, which is now in Heaven; therefore (as I have ſhewed before) that the Eating of his Fleſh ſignifieth only the Union of his Fleſh with our fleſh; ſo the Drinking of his Blood or Soul ſignifieth, only the union of his Soul with our Souls, which two Unions, <hi>viz.</hi> of our fleſh and ſouls with his Fleſh and Soul, are ſo neceſſary, in order to the redemption of our bodies by his Body, and of our ſouls by his Soul, that otherwiſe we could not with Juſtice be redeemed by him.</p>
               <p>This Union which ſeemeth ſo ſecret and myſterious, is declared to us by Chriſt in this Figurative or Metaphorical ſpeech of <hi>Drinking his Blood,</hi> which is all one, as if he had ſaid, except my Soul be united with your Souls; ſo as that wine which you drink for your food and nouriſhment, is turned into your Blood, and then is joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and united with your Perſons, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes One with you, otherwiſe your Souls cannot be redeemed by me; for the word <hi>Blood</hi> ſignifies the <hi>Soul</hi> of Chriſt, and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his Blood certainly ſignifies the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, or union of his Soul with our Souls, in order as a neceſſary way or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, to put us into a capacity of redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of our ſouls by his Soul. For we
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:98443:62"/>
cannot be capable of the benefits of the Paſſions, death, and Obedience of Chriſt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we be One with him, both by the union of our fleſh with his Fleſh, and of our ſouls with his Soul; becauſe God doth neither puniſh, nor reward one for another, as is at <note place="margin">Chap. 4.</note> large ſhewed before.</p>
               <p>Therefore, that the Son of God might be every way fitly qualified to be a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer of Mankind, he aſſumed human Fleſh from the ſame Original that we had our fleſh, that thereby he might be a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer of our fleſh or bodies; and he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed an human Soul from the ſame Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, from which all our Souls ſprang, that thereby he might be a Redeemer of our ſouls, as <hi>Athanaſius</hi> hath obſerved in his <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Athan. T.</hi> 3. <hi>n.</hi> 23.</note> Book of the Incarnation, <hi>In Redemptione corpus pro corpore, &amp; anima pro anima red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denda fuit, &amp; integrum aliquid pro integro homine; He was to give his Body for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of our bodies, and to yield up his Soul for our Souls, and his whole Man for our whole Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are three Ingredients to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in the Redeemer. 1. His Divinity or Godhead (for he was and is God, the moſt High, and the only God.) 2. His hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Fleſh or Body. 3. His human Soul. By the two latter by him ſo aſſumed, as is
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:98443:63"/>
ſaid, he became <hi>Perfect Man;</hi> as by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer he was, and is <hi>Perfect God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His pure Godhead alone, and conſidered without his Human nature aſſumed, could not be a Redeemer, becauſe the law was not impoſed upon God, or the Son of God, as only ſo, but upon Mankind or Sons of Men: Nor could the pure Godhead ſuffer death, which was to be ſuffered by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.</p>
               <p>Or if the Godhead had aſſumed only an human Body or Fleſh, without an human Soul; this could have been but a Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of the Body, at moſt (if that) but not of the Soul.</p>
               <p>Or if the Godhead had aſſumed only an human Soul without a Body, it could not have redeemed our bodies, nor our whole Man, as the Axiome of Divines teacheth us. <hi>Diviſus Chriſtus non eſt Salvator,</hi> viz. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Beza Cat. Part.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 18.</note> If Chriſt had not united all theſe Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents in his one Perſon, his Godhead, his Fleſh and his Soul, we could not have him for our Saviour.</p>
               <p>Or if Chriſt had been only a meer Man, conſiſting of Soul and Body, as we all do, and had not been God, he could not have been our Redeemer; becauſe it was only his Divinity, joyned with, and united per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally with his Fleſh and Soul, that gave
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:98443:63"/>
luſtre, worth, and infinite value to his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature, ſo that (for the great work of mans Redemption) it was neceſſary that the Redeemer ſhould be, not only <hi>Perfect Man of a reaſonable Soul, and Human fleſh ſubſiſting,</hi> but alſo with them <hi>Perfect God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or if Chriſt, being very God, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally aſſumed a Body, and alſo a Soul other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and not from his Virgin Mother; but had made a Body, and alſo created a Soul for himſelf, which had not been derived from Mankind, and ſo not united with our bodies and ſouls; or if his Body or Soul had come down from Heaven (as ſome He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks ſaid) and paſſed through the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins Womb only, as water doth through a pipe, and had been only for a time an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant, or Inmate of the Womb, and had not been really the <hi>Seed of the Woman,</hi> and <hi>the Son of the Virgin,</hi> and the very <hi>Fruit of the Womb</hi> both in Soul and in Body, and derived from the firſt Man, and the firſt Woman, as we all are; he could not have been our Redeemer, becauſe he could not be united otherwiſe with all Mankind in fleſh and ſoul, nor we with him.</p>
               <p>For as our Union with his Fleſh (which is called the Eating of his fleſh) muſt needs be with it, as it is the fleſh of the Son of Man, which ſignifieth, that it muſt be with
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:98443:64"/>
that Fleſh or Body of his, which he aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and derived from Mankind, by being conceived in the Womb, and not from any other fleſh or body, which the Son of God had ſometime taken on him, otherwiſe than by Conception and Birth, (as is before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in his Apparition, and converſe with the Patriark <hi>Abraham)</hi> ſo likewiſe the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Gen. 18. <hi>Suprac.</hi> 6, 7.</note> of our Souls with his Soul (which is called the <hi>Drinking of his Blood)</hi> muſt be with that Soul of his, which was ſo deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the firſt Man, and the firſt Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man by Propagation, as all our Souls are, otherwiſe we cannot be united in our Souls with his Soul, neither could he be a Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of our Souls.</p>
               <p>This Doctrine of our Union with Chriſt, both in our Bodies, and alſo in our Souls was intimated, though ſomething darkly (as to me ſeemeth) at the Inſtitution of his holy Euchariſtical Supper, which is next to be very briefly touched.</p>

               <p>WHen our Saviour had a long time concealed the Myſterious way, or manner how our Redemption was to be
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:98443:64"/>
effected by him; and how his own proper and perſonal Death, might be ſatisfactory to Divine Juſtice, for, and inſtead of the deſerved deaths of all Men: Yet (that he Might not leave his Diſciples altogether ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant in ſo weighty a Concernment) he was pleaſed a little before his death, in ſome meaſure to reveal that Secret to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and by them to his ſucceeding Church, for which purpoſe only, he inſtituted his laſt <hi>Holy Supper,</hi> to be a viſible Sign or Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and alſo a Memorial thereof in all Generations, untill his Coming again.</p>

                  <hi>Panis)</hi> becauſe, as bread being eaten and digeſted, becomes incorporate or incarnate with us; ſo is Chriſt Incarnate, or rather Concarnate with us. We receive our Fleſh from our Mothers, the bread which the Mother eateth, is converted into milk, with which the Infant is nouriſhed, and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:98443:65"/>
thereby is fleſhed and groweth; ſo that the Bread and the Child become united, and grow into one Body.</p>

               <p>Such is the Union of the Fleſh of Chriſt with our fleſh, becauſe both he, and we recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved our fleſh from that one Original lump of the firſt Man, wherein both he and we were united, and thereby he and we became one Body, juſt as our food becomes one fleſh and one body with that Body of ours, which we had, before any new Addition was made to it by any new food, which is the reaſon why the Scripture accounteth Chriſt and his Members to be but one Body, as the Apoſtle ſaith; <hi>We being many, are one</hi>

And for this conſideration only, and for this reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance only, Chriſt ſaid of the Sacramental Bread, <hi>This is my Body which is given for you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Likewiſe of the <hi>Wine</hi> Chriſt ſaid, <hi>This is my Blood—Drink ye all of this.</hi> We know that by <hi>Blood,</hi> the life or ſoul is ſignified (as is before proved) therefore the Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Wine repreſented his Soul; the Wine which we drink (as well as the Bread which we eat) becomes our nouriſhment, and ſo unites it ſelf with our Perſons, and grows into one bulk with us, and is really one with us, and thereby it becomes to us ſuch as the Soul of Chriſt is already to us; for our ſouls and the Soul of Chriſt are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally united, becauſe his Soul, and our ſouls, and the ſouls of all our Anceſtors and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterities ever were, and ſtill will be deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and propagated from that one Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Soul of the firſt Man, in whoſe Soul at its very Creation and Inſufflation, the Soul of Chriſt, and all our Souls are virtually
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:98443:66"/>
included and united: Therefore ſurely, the meaning of thoſe words of Chriſt muſt be this, that his Soul and our Souls muſt have been ſo united, as well as his Fleſh and our fleſh, that ſo he may be fitly the Redeemer both of our Bodies and of our Souls; for certainly, no man can have Redemption by him, except (as a neceſſary Preparative thereunto) he be really united with him, both in Fleſh and in Soul, which is that very thing which Chriſt called <hi>the Eating of his Fleſh, and Drinking his Blood.</hi>

               <p>Thoſe likewiſe that teach the withhold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Sacramental Chalice from the People, or Lay-Communicants, do miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the meaning thereof; they pretend, that after the pronouncing of the words of <hi>their Conſecration,</hi> the Wine is not Wine, for that the ſubſtance of Wine is quite gone and annihilated, leaving nothing behind but only the meer Accidents, <hi>viz.</hi> the colour, taſte, and quantity of the Wine, but not
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:98443:67"/>
the Wine it ſelf, and that the Chalice doth contain only the Blood of Chriſt inſtead of the Wine; and becauſe they make the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple believe, that in their little <hi>Wafer-Hoſt,</hi> the whole Chriſt is contained, <hi>viz.</hi> his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Blood, therefore in Receiving the Hoſt, they receive both the Fleſh, and the Blood by <hi>Concomitancy.</hi> But herein they err, in that they think that by the word <hi>Blood,</hi> only meer blood is meant, which indeed doth ſignifie not literally Blood, but the Soul of Chriſt, in which Soul if the People do not really Communicate, that is, if their Souls be not really united with the Soul of Chriſt, they cannot be in a full capacity of the Redemption of their ſouls by his Soul. Beſides, what need was there, that Chriſt ſhould require with the Eating of his fleſh particularly, as another thing, the Drinking of his Blood; if by Blood he had meant only <hi>meer Blood,</hi> ſeeing that the living Fleſh of Chriſt muſt needs include his Blood, as themſelves acknowledge.</p>
               <p>The laborious and tedious Diſputes of Divines, of contrary Perſuaſions in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on concerning the preſence of Chriſt in the Sacrament, whether it be a <hi>carnal and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral</hi> Preſence, or only a <hi>Spiritual Preſence,</hi> I conceive (with ſubmiſſion to Superiors) to have been as needleſs, as we have found

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:98443:68"/>
firmly believe to be true,) <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Eating and Drinking of His fleſh and blood,</hi> ſignifieth only <hi>the union or conjunction of his Fleſh and Soul with our fleſh and ſoul;</hi> all difficulties and obſcurities will be cleared without any violence to thoſe words of Chriſt. And the order and method, in which the juſt and mercifull Godhead pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in preparing, and in making a way to the Redemption of our lapſed Nature, will be (to our great Conſolation) made manifeſt to us.</p>
               <p>We have ſeen before, how our fleſh, and the Fleſh of Chriſt have been united; in the next place, we are now to ſhow, how the Union of our ſouls with his Soul hath been wrought, and really performed.</p>

               <p>IN order to the underſtanding of the Union of our Souls with the Soul of Chriſt (which is myſteriouſly vailed, by an obſcure deſcription under a Figurative Speech of <hi>Drinking his Blood,)</hi> we are firſt to enquire of, and to find out the <hi>Original</hi> or <hi>Spring,</hi> whence both Chriſt, and we have derived and received our Souls; For if it
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:98443:68"/>
may appear, that the human Soul of Chriſt did proceed from the very ſame Fountain, from which all Men in the world have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their Souls; then it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, that his Soul and our ſouls, were joyned and united in that one Original Fountain, which is <hi>the Soul of the first Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For, why ſhould it ſeem leſs credible or harder to conceive, that all Human Souls are derived, and have proceeded from that one Soul of the firſt Man, than to believe and acknowledge, that all Human Bodies, Chriſts and all, are derived and propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the body or lump of the ſaid firſt Man? Surely no Learned, or but Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Chriſtian will deny, that Chriſt, and all Men were united in the <hi>Loins of Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if it be enquired whence, or from whom Chriſt immediately received his Soul? We anſwer, that he received it from his Bleſſed <hi>Virgin Mother,</hi> and in her Womb, and that it was derived and propagated from her Virgin Soul, for he had no Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father, from whoſe Thigh his Soul could be propagated.</p>
               <p>If it be again enquired, whence the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Virgin</hi> received her Soul? We anſwer, that ſhe alſo received it from her Mothers Soul, and in the Womb, and ſo we affirm
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:98443:69"/>
of all the ſouls of Men and Women, that they are propagated from the ſouls of their Mothers, and that this Propagation aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth ultimately unto <hi>Eve</hi> the firſt Woman, from whoſe Soul the Soul of Chriſt, and the Souls of all her Poſterity are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended.</p>
               <p>If it be farther enquired, when <hi>Eve</hi> had, and received her Soul? We anſwer, that ſhe received her Soul with her Body alſo from the firſt Man, her Body from his Body, and her Soul from his Soul; and whence <hi>Adam</hi> received his Soul, the Scripture evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declareth, that his Soul was immediately Created and Inſpired by God, in theſe words, <hi>God breathed into his noſtrils the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 2. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>breath of Life, and Man became a living Soul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We farther affirm, that the Soul of <hi>Adam</hi> was the only Soul that was created by God; and alſo, that from that one Soul, all human Souls from that time till now, and alſo untill the end of the World are, and will be derived and propagated. We read not of any other particular Soul in the Holy Scriptures, that was immediately cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by God, becauſe, indeed all Human Souls were Originally couched, and virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally included in that one <hi>Prime Soul</hi> of the firſt Man, Inſpired by God.</p>

               <p>We know that the firſt Woman had a Soul proper to her ſelf, but we find not that God did newly Create, or Breath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her a new and ſeveral Soul, becauſe ſhe did receive her ſoul from the Man, and ſo it muſt have been produced for weighty Reaſons, and not any other way; her ſoul was derived from his ſoul; the Godhead did not create two Originals, or Fountains

hath made of one Soul all the ſouls of all nations of Men, which ſurely is true.</p>
               <p>For if their was a neceſſity, in order to the Redemption of our Bodies, that the <hi>Redeemer</hi> muſt have received his fleſh by Propagation from the firſt Man; the like neceſſity muſt needs be for the Redemption of our Souls, that the Redeemer muſt have received his Soul by <hi>Traduction</hi> from the Soul of the ſame firſt Man, in whom the Redeemer and the Redeemed, were neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily to have been united in ſoul, as well as in body, otherwiſe he could be but an Half-Redeemer, and we but <hi>Semiredempti,</hi> i. e. redeemed but in one part, or <hi>half-redeemed,</hi> for it would prove but a Redemption of our Bodies only, and not of our Souls.</p>

               <p>THE Doctrine of the Original of the Soul of Chriſt, and of all human Souls, and conſequently the Doctrine of the Redemption of our ſouls by the Soul of Chriſt, hath been much obſcured by the vain, and trifling Arguments of ſome na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural <hi>Philoſophers;</hi> and as much by the fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous Queries of ſome late <hi>Theologues,</hi> whereas ſome learned <hi>Phyſicians</hi> (to whom <note place="margin">

And the Souls of all Mothers (as is before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid) are derived from the Soul of the firſt

Man; unto which Doctrine all men, who do rightly apprehend and underſtand the order and method of Redemption, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> of Chriſt with Mankind, will be driven at laſt to conſent.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Men that oppoſe the <hi>Traduction of Souls</hi> from the Soul of <hi>Adam,</hi> demand how it is poſſible, that ſuch an innumerable company of Souls can be derived from one ſingle Soul, ſeeing the Soul is a Spirit, and indiviſible, and therefore not to be parted by Deciſions, and mincings into ſuch ſeveral parcels; for ſo in time it would have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left to it ſelf, but would be utterly annihilated.</p>
               <p>But theſe Men may as reaſonably doubt, how ſo many thouſands of Bodies could proceed from that one ſingle Body of the firſt Man, during the 930 years of his life, without any diminution of the quantity or dimenſions of his Body, ſeeing they were all Originally in his Loyns.

               <p>The brute Creatures, ever ſince their firſt Creation, did propagate their Souls to

their kind; and to this day thoſe Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do receive their ſouls by Traduction from their Dams. The greateſt Scioliſts in Natural Philoſophy, cannot reaſonably prove any other Original of thoſe brute Souls, but only by propagation, which yet they deny to human Souls.</p>
               <p>It muſt be confeſſed (by Chriſtians) that the ſouls of brute Creatures were at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning created by God, as the reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Soul of <hi>Adam</hi> was; yet the ſouls of Brute Creatures are mortal, but the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Souls of Men are immortal; the reaſon is, becauſe the Divine Nature did perſonally unite it ſelf with our whole hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature, which is the only reaſon why human Souls do not die, and that human Bodies after death, ſhall riſe again to Life, at the general Reſurrection. But the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, did not ſo unite it ſelf with the nature of thoſe other inferiour Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which are therefore left to periſh utterly: Of which ſomething hath been <note place="margin">Cap. 11.</note> ſaid before, and more will be ſaid in its due place.</p>
               <p>The prime cauſe of the propagation of Human ſouls,, is the gift of God by his Benediction, recorded in theſe words, <hi>God bleſſed them, and ſaid unto them, be fruitfull,</hi>

                  <hi>and multiply, and repleniſh the Earth.</hi> Can
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:98443:73"/>
we imagin that this Benediction of fruit-fulneſs and multiplying, ſhould extend to fleſh, or bodies only, and not to Souls? Whereas the like bleſſing of fiſhes and fowls, enabled them to produce and propagate not only bodies, but the whole Creatures, <hi>viz.</hi> both the bodies, and the ſouls of their Kinds, of which Benediction we thus read, <hi>God created Whales, and every living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>

                  <hi>and multiply,</hi> &amp;c. By vertue of this <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,</hi> thoſe Creature are enabled unto this day, to produce their kinds, both in bodies and in ſouls.

               <p>It may ſeem ſtrange that thoſe Divines, who confeſs the <hi>Traduction</hi> of our bodies with the Body of Chriſt, from the loyns of the firſt Man, as being neceſſary for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of our bodies; yet that they ſhould deny the Traduction of our Souls, with the Soul of Chriſt from the firſt Man, which is altogether as needfull for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of our Soul.</p>

                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:98443:74"/>
In the Holy Scripture, care is taken to declare the derivation of our ſouls from our Parents, rather than of our Bodies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that of Souls is more ſecret than the other of Bodies. <hi>Gen.</hi> 46. 26. it is ſaid; <note place="margin">Gen. 46. 26.</note>

               <p>How Souls can be truly ſaid to come from the loyns, or thigh of the Man (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Figure or Metonymy) is hard to be underſtood, except we will thus apprehend it, <hi>viz.</hi> that although the Souls of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, being in the Womb, are immediately, and truly derived from the ſouls of the Mothers; yet they are here ſaid to come from the loyns of the Man, becauſe the ſeed of Conception, which came from the Man, hath it it ſelf <hi>Potentiam receptivam,</hi> a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or capacity of receiving the ſoul or life, (though it hath not <hi>Potentiam producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vam,</hi> any power of it ſelf to produce, or introduce the Soul:) And becauſe the Womb alone, without that ſeminal conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption from the Man, cannot produce a ſoul or life, therefore are the Souls ſaid to come from the loyns of the Man; for there never was, nor ever will be a Child-bearing Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, without the Cooperation of Man or Malekind, except only that miraculous

Now if it be granted, that our ſouls come from the Souls of our Parents, and alſo, that they are not tranſmitted with the Seed from the Father; it will follow, that they cannot in reaſon be thought to be propagated from the Father; becauſe no Man will believe, that after ſo long a time, whilſt the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception remains in the womb without life or ſoul, and alſo the Man being abſent, in a far remote diſtance of place from the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (as it may, and doth many times hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen) I ſay it cannot be imagined, that at the inſtant of Quickning, the Soul or Life ſhould wander from the Father, by a kind of <hi>Metempſychoſis,</hi> or Tranſmigration, unto the mothers Womb. This being impoſſible, it muſt follow, that the Soul neceſſarily doth proceed, and is derived only, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from the Soul of the mother, wherein, if ſhe fail, by reaſon of ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Indiſpoſition of the Womb, ſhe is called <hi>Barren,</hi> and becauſe the Animation of the Conception is only from the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, therefore (becauſe of her failing therein) <hi>Barrenneſs</hi> is imputed only to the <note place="margin">Jer. 22. 30.</note> Woman, and not at all to the Man, though Childleſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:98443:75"/>
It is ſo with the Seed of Man, which is conceived in the Womb, as it is with meat received into the ſtomach, which hath no life in it ſelf <hi>Actually,</hi> but it hath a power or capacity to receive life, which life it will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards <hi>actually</hi> receive, when it ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally united with the former parts of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, for then the life and ſoul will enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, as they did before, into all the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional parts of our Bodies; for we ſee that our bodies have been augmented by our food, and have grown into ſo great a bulk, from our ſo ſmall dimenſions at our Birth.</p>
               <p>This being evidently true, why ſhould it ſeem leſs credible, that the Soul of the mother entreth into, and enliveneth her Conception in the womb; then it is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and acknowledge, that the Soul doth enter into and enliven the new acquired parts of our Bodies, which have been added by our food?</p>
               <p>The time and manner of the Soul's en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into the Conception, is thus deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by that learned Phyſician before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; when (ſaith he) the parts of the <hi>Embryon</hi> are once ſhaped, formed, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected <note place="margin">Jac. Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtius.</note> to that uſe in the womb, then doth the life or ſoul of the Mother, together with the Vital Spirit, proceed from her
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:98443:76"/>
heart, and enter into that fruit of her womb. This is the time when we receive our Souls, by traduction from the ſouls of our Mothers; and this is the time of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> of our ſouls with the Soul of Chriſt, which Chriſt himſelf called <hi>Drinking his Blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That common ſaying concerning the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal of the Soul, <hi>Creando infunditur, &amp; infundendo creatur;</hi> if it be meant of every particular human Soul, is very erroneous and untheological, and will appear anon to be Heretical; becauſe it is deſtructive of the Doctrine of Redemption, except we will confine it, and underſtand it to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken only of the Soul of <hi>Adam,</hi> which was the firſt, and the only human Soul, that ever could truly and properly be ſaid to be ſo created and infuſed.</p>
               <p>Neither is the time of Drinking the Blood of Chriſt to be confined, or thought to be firſt performed, when we receive the Sacrament thereof, becauſe the Blood of Chriſt is not really in the Sacramental Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, neither is his Soul there, but his blood or Soul are in the Communicants, for this drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of his Blood (which is really intended by thoſe words) muſt have been performed, although the Sacrament had never been ſet up; for we drink the Blood of Chriſt at
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:98443:76"/>
our quickning in the Womb, becauſe then our blood or ſouls, are united with the Blood or Soul of Chriſt, when we are not in any capacity of Receiving the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof: Therefore all the <hi>Latine Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> and all <hi>later Theological Writers,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they are of ſeveral and oppoſite Perſuaſions in Religion, yet they general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Read thoſe words of Chriſt, <hi>Niſi Biberi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> which I conceive to ſignifie a <hi>Tenſe</hi> of the <hi>time paſt, Except ye have drank,</hi> as is obſerved before of the word <hi>Eat.</hi> The fleſh and blood of Chriſt is not now to be eaten and drank really, for that was actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally performed before, even at our Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with his Fleſh and Soul, in our Mothers Wombs.</p>

               <p>Theſe erroneous Opinions, diſturbed the doctrine of our redemption by Chriſt, which Redemption neceſſarily preſuppoſeth an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of our ſouls with the Soul of Chriſt, which Union cannot otherwiſe be found, but only in the Original Fountain of all our Souls, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Soul of the firſt Man.</p>
               <p>Let it now be conſidered, whether the preſent vulgar Opinions, and the Doctrines of ſome Divines and Neoterick Writers, be not altogether as deſtructive of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Redemption, as thoſe Errors of

the aboveſaid Ancient Hereticks were, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe Men affirm, that human Souls are by thouſands dayly and newly Created, whereby they buſie the Godhead with new Creations of Souls upon the quickning of every Conception, whereby they manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare, that they deny the Union of our Souls, with the Soul of Chriſt in the firſt Man, and conſequently deprave and nullifie the doctrine of the Redemption of our ſouls by his Soul. Certainly there muſt be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Union of our Souls, as well as of our bodies with the Body and Soul of Chriſt, for otherwiſe he could not be a Redeemer of our bodies and ſouls.</p>
               <p>Yet in this Doctrine concerning the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Soul of Chriſt, with the Souls of us Men (which we have here aſſerted) we are not ſo to be underſtood, as if we meant or affirmed, that there is but one particular Soul of all Men, which was the error of <hi>Averroes</hi> an <hi>Ethnick</hi> Philoſopher, about 1150 Years of Chriſt, as <hi>Tolet</hi> reporteth; <note place="margin">

               <p>But our Aſſertion doth not in the leaſt gainſay the Plurality of the Souls of Men, more than the Plurality of their Bodies; for as multitudes of fruits and flowers, may grow and proceed from one Tree, or one Stalk, and yet, we ſay not that they are but <hi>One fruit,</hi> or but one <hi>Flower:</hi> So, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though all our Bodies, and all our Souls, ſprang from that One Body, and that One Soul of the firſt Man, yet there are, and will be innumerable particular Bodies and Souls.

               <p>Sometimes (we know) worms are bred in mens Bodies, and derive their fleſh and bulk from them, yet it would be ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to ſay or imagin, that theſe worms draw original ſin from thoſe Human bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, becauſe they are therein bred, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any copulation or carnal concupiſcence. <hi>Herod was eaten of worms,</hi> which were bred <note place="margin">Acts 12. 23.</note> in his own body, yet thoſe worms by that Generation, did not derive any ſin from <hi>Herod.</hi> And if now any Man ſhould be miraculouſly produced, and formed out of another mans Body, he ſhould not thereby attract any ſin, becauſe ſuch a Production would be without copulation and luſt, as <note place="margin">

               <p>For certain then, the bleſſed Mother of our Redeemer was a pure Virgin, untill the Birth of her Son <hi>Jeſus;</hi> but whether ſhe continued and perſevered in her Virginity, untill her death is not neceſſary, or much pertinent to be conſidered in this Queſtion, it being a full, and ſufficient argument of the pure and ſinleſs Conception, and Birth of Chriſt, that he was <hi>born of the Virgin Mary,</hi> during her Virginity. <hi>Mariam Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph concubitu nec cognoverat, nec cogniturus erat.</hi> Auguſt.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> of Chriſt with Mankind, both in Fleſh, and in Soul, and the <hi>Modus</hi> or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, how it is brought to paſs.

               </p>
               <p>Now for Concluſion, I ſhall only enquire, what effects and iſſues are produced by this <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> which is ſignified by Eating and Drinking.</p>
               <p>And theſe I find to be Two. 1. <hi>Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality</hi> of all Human Souls whatſoever, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all Men, good and bad, are united with Chriſt in Soul. 2. The <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of all Human Bodies, both of holy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy Perſons, becauſe all are united with Chriſt in Fleſh. Both the effects may clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear by the words of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>For Firſt he ſaith, <hi>Except ye Eat the Fleſh,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">John 6. 53.</note> &amp;c. <hi>ye have no life in you;</hi> therefore they that have ſo eaten his Fleſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have life in them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In the very next words he ſaith, <hi>Whoſo eateth my Fleſh, and drinketh my Blood,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">54.</note> 
                  <hi>hath Eternal Life, and I will raiſe him up at the Laſt day.</hi> 1. <hi>Eternal Life,</hi> is meant of the Immortality of all Human Souls. 2. <hi>Raiſing up at the Laſt day,</hi> ſignifieth the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Human Bodies at the laſt Judgment.</p>
               <p>From theſe Premiſes we may eaſily col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, that becauſe all Men, both Good and Bad, are really united with Chriſt, both in Soul and Fleſh (as hath been proved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:98443:89"/>
therefore all Men, both good and bad, ſhall have Eternal life, <hi>viz.</hi> Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Souls, and Reſurrection of Bodies.</p>
               <p>If it be queſtioned, whether the Damned may be ſaid to have <hi>Eternal life,</hi> becauſe they have been united with Chriſt, ſo as is ſaid?</p>
               <p>We anſwer Yes. For their Souls are Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal, as really as the Souls of the Bleſſed, and their Bodies ſhall be raiſed to Life at the general Reſurrection, as truly as the Bodies of the Saints; both the Bleſſed and the Damned, in Bodies and in Souls, ſhall then have Everlaſting life, the one in happineſs, the other in Miſery.</p>
               <p>And although the Miſerable State and condition of the Damned (as <hi>Beza</hi> ſaith) <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bez. Cat. p.</hi> 31.</note> is not worthy to be called <hi>Life,</hi> and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called <hi>Eternal Death,</hi> and <hi>Everlaſting Damnation,</hi> yet it is ſuch a death as is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Mors ſine morte, &amp;</hi>

The mention of <hi>Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fire,</hi> implieth everlaſting Bodies, and in that it is ſaid, that <hi>Death is to be deſtroyed;</hi> this argues, that then there will be no more Dying, and therefore it is ſaid, <hi>The Dead ſhall be raiſed incorruptible;</hi> And <hi>this mortal ſhall put on Immortality,</hi> and this is true, both

               <p>This being evident, we are further to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, what is the efficient, or true cauſe of the Immortality of Human Souls, and of the Reſurrection of Human Bodies, more than of the ſouls and bodies of other inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Creatures, although their bodies and ſouls were at firſt Created by God, as ours were; and therefore the <hi>Mahumetans</hi> ſay, that there ſhall be a Reſurrection of Brute creatures, as <hi>Armachanus</hi> reporteth; and <note place="margin">

               <p>To this our Anſwer is, That becauſe Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man bodies and Souls, are united with the Body and Soul of Chriſt, in the firſt Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Soul and Body, therefore our Souls are Immortal, and our Bodies ſhall riſe immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal;

                  <hi>Father,</hi> ſo our Souls are, and our Bodies ſhall be Immortal, becauſe they are united with the Body and Soul of <hi>the Son of God;</hi> and this, not by vertue of his meer Soul, and his meer Fleſh, both of them being of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves but Creatures, but becauſe his Soul and Body are, and ever were perſonally u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited with the Divine Spirit, or Godhead; that is it only, which cauſed this kind of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality in all Mankind, for of his meer Fleſh alone Chriſt ſaith, <hi>The Fleſh profiteth nothing.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 6. 63</note> But of the Spirit or Godhead, united with his Fleſh, he ſaith, <hi>It is the Spirit that quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, the words that I ſpeak unto you, they are Spirit, and they are Life;</hi> and therefore the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith of the whole Perſon of Chriſt, <hi>The laſt Adam was made a quickning</hi>

                  <hi>Spirit,</hi> that is, He was made ſo by Union with the Godhead, for the Fleſh of Chriſt alone was mortal, but by this Union, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came both <hi>Vital</hi> and <hi>Vivifical.</hi>
